Title: Customer Churn Analysis for a Telecom Company

Summary:
This project aims to identify why customers leave a telecom service and to predict which customers are most likely to churn in the future. Using the Telco Customer Churn dataset, the project analyzes customer behavior based on factors such as tenure, monthly charges, complaints, and service subscriptions. After exploring the data, a machine learning model is built to classify customers as “churn” or “non-churn.” Feature importance techniques like ELI5/SHAP are applied to understand the key reasons for customer churn. Finally, customers are segmented into groups such as “At Risk,” “Loyal,” and “Dormant,” and practical recommendations are provided to help the telecom company reduce churn and improve customer retention
